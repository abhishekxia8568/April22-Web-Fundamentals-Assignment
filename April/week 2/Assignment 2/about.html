        <h3>BJP</h3>
        <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party Indian People's Party'; abbr. BJP) is one of two major political parties in India, along
              with the Indian National Congress.[35] It has been the ruling political party of the Republic
               of India since 2014 under its prime minister, Narendra Modi.[36] The BJP is a right-wing party,
                and its policy has historically reflected Hindu nationalist positions.[37][38] It has close
                 ideological and organisational links to the much older Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).[39]
                  As of 17 February 2022, it is the country's largest political party in terms of representat
                  ion in the national parliament and state legislatures.</p>

        The BJP's origin lies in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, formed in 1951 by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.[40] 
        After the State of Emergency in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the 
        Janata Party; it defeated the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election. After three years
         in power, the Janata party dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening
          to form the BJP. Although initially unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the 1984 general election
          , it grew in strength on the back of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Following victories in several
           state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest party in
            the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its
             government, under its then leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee lasted only 13 days.
