        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
             It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms
             may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for 
             text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle
              brackets. Tags such as directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and
             provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags
             but use them to interpret the content of the page

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can
             improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
              multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
               repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages
                that share the file and its formatting.

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic
             typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional,
             and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
              expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
